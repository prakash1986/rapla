The main view is divided into three parts: The menu area, the selection area on the left side, and the the large calendar area in the center.

In the function selection area you will find all the available Rapla functions. If you click on one of them the work-area will change to the appropriate view:


(1) ''resources/persons'' shows in the selection tree all filtered resources (see point 3).
''events'' accordingly the filtered events.

(2) here you can specify, which resources/persons/events are shown in the tree. You find more details under Filter.

(3) Choose the objects from tree, which should be visible in the calendar. Hold the CTRL key to select multiple objects. If you mark a father knot (e.g. room), all underlying objects (in this case all rooms) are indicated. With a right-click you activate a context menu with object-dependent actions, such as edit/remove or create new ...

(4) With the date selection you can change into another calendar week, by entering a new date or clicking on the left or right arrows.

(5) The view selection lets you switcht between the different views in rapla, like month, week, day, resource/day or table view.

(6) in the calendar field you can create new events, change existing ones and change the allocation of resources.


In the bottom left corner youl find the confict view.
Conflicts are something you would like to avoid, but from time to time conflicts develop such when two persons reserved the same room for the same period. The conflict view offers means of recognizing and eliminating conflicts. More information under [Conflicts](Conflicts.md)
