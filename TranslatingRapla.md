# Translating Rapla into another language #

### You will need: ###
  * an text-editor that understands utf-8, preferably an xml-editor.
  * the source distribution. See [BuildGuide](BuildGuide.md)!

Open `src/org/rapla/RaplaResources.xml` (`src\org\rapla\RaplaResources.xml` under windows)
in the text-editor. You will find all neccessary information there.
