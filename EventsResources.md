Resources and appointments are the basis of all resource-management. With the help of Rapla you can easily collect and manage the necessary information.

## resources/persons ##

Resources can be, among other things, rooms, computers, projectors, cars etc.
By creating different resource-type with different attributes and categorisations you can customize Rapla to your needs.

The managemant of schedules for people in Rapla is exactly the same as with resources. Therefore resources and personnel are combined into a single dialogue.


## events/appointments ##

An event consists of one or more appointment(s), on which the event takes place. Each appointment of an event can be one-time continuous or recurring. In comparison to other calendar-application Rapla makes it possible to manage different appointments, such as
  * ''monday 8-10 (weekly except the 12/10/2003) ''
  * ''thursday 10-12 (every 2 weeks)''
  * ''friday 18/10 13-15 (one time)''
bringing events together in one view, instead of creating three separate events with the same information.

Each event can be associated with one ore more resources. By default a resource is assigned to all appointments, but you can also make assignments like: On monday room A and on tuesday room B.

As with resources and persons, you can also create custom event-types with different attributes like lectures, practical courses or conferences.
