Rapla is a flexible multi-user resource and event management system. The primary target of the program was universities. It allows coordination beetween the lectures and the administration.

It started as simple room booking software at the [Institute of Computer Science](http://www.informatik.uni-bonn.de/) in Bonn in 2000 but it has evolved into a fully configurable framework for event and resource management.
