## Do you need period-support? ##

Most universities and schools are planning for fixed periods/terms rather than arbitrary dates. Rapla provides support for this periods.

## How do I enable period-support? ##

You can enter the start, end and the name of a period under the periods-option in the reservation-usecase (You need administration priviliges)
Use abbreviations for the period names: WS 2002/2003 instead of Wintersemester 2002 - 2003.

Avoid overlapping periods, if possible.

'''WARNING:''' Changing period start and end dates doesn't affect any reservations. You must alter the begin and enddate of the reservations separately. Better avoid changing a period after reservations are made for that period.

## Period support enables the following features: ##

Period-Wizard
> You can use the period-wizard for creating new reservations
Filter
> You can select reservations according to their periods. A reservation belongs to a period if one of its appointments overlap with the period. A reservation can belong to multiple periods.
In the week-view
> You can directly jump to the start of a period with the period selector
While editing an appointment
> If the start of an appointment is in a period, then the name of the period and the week of the period are displayed. You can choose the start of the period as start of the appointment and the end of the period as end of repeating appointment.
Appointment display
> If both start- and enddate of the repeating matches a period, then the period name is displayed instead of the start/end dates.
