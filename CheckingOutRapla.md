## Checkout information ##

we changed from subversion to git, to use the enhanced clone and branch functionality of git. You can checkout the latest sources from.

http://code.google.com/p/rapla/source/checkout

To use git in eclipse install the egit plugin. Note that the eclipse project name changed from Rapla to rapla.

## Github and subversion mirrors ##

A Github mirror of the main project is also available at

https://github.com/rapla/rapla/

The old svn repository still works but it won't get updated.
If you want to keep up with the latest changes but don't want to use git
use

https://rapla-svn.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

instead of

https://rapla.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

unfortunatly google doesnt allow to use git and svn in one project so i had to create a second just for mirroring. Please let me know if anyone needs a svnsyncing of the branches or the plugins as well.
